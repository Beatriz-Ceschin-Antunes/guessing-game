Project created for the class CMPSC 122 Intermediate Programming during the Summer 2024 semester.

# Guessing Game
This Guessing Game program allows the user to play a guessing game with the computer. The goal is to guess the random number generated by the computer with the help of just one hint per round.

## What I learned
- Using a random number generator, control structures and functions in C++.
- Implementing a binary search algorithm to make guessing more efficient.
